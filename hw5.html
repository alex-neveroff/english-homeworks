            <h1 class="title">Why did you leave your previous job?</h1>
            <p class="main-text-item">
              My last job was related to copywriting and media content, which I
              must upload on sites through the admin panel.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text-item">
              I like my last job and wonderful team, but I lost my motivation to
              do that job. I understood that I want not only work with websites
              but create and develop them. And in the process of JavaScript
              studying, I realized that solving such tasks is mine.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text-item">
              So, I want not just to change jobs, but to change the profession.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="main-text">
            <h2 class="title">
              What are you looking for in your next job and employer?
            </h2>
            <p class="main-text-item">
              Firstly, I want to program as much as possible. It would be ideal
              to get a lot of interesting and challenging tasks, but I also like
              a routine one too.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text-item">
              Secondly, I hope for the support of the employer in cases where I,
              as a beginner, can not cope with the work as quickly as an
              experienced professional.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text-item">
              Thirdly, I would want to work with a friendly team. I treat people
              with respect and positivity and would like reciprocity. Actually,
              that's usually what happens.
