              Two weeks ago I would have said that the most important is Job
              security because it means employees don’t lose their job with a
              very high probability.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text-item">But now I think differently.</p>
            <p class="main-text-item">
              Two last weeks I worked a couple of hours at night and a couple of
              hours during the day and due to an emergency power outage, I
              didn't know when these hours would come. I couldn't relax even at
              night, couldn't properly prepare for work and study so I'm
              disappointed with my results for this period.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text-item">
              So I think that the employees must have sufficient time for their
              own lives. I mean that harmony is needed. Time for work, time for
              study, time for family and leisure, including sleep. Yin and yang.
              Then their efficiency at work will be the highest. Perfect
              work/life balance almost guarantees high performance at work.
